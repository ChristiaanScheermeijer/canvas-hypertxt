# Canvas HyperTxt 🚀📐✍

A zero dependency featherweight library to layout text on a canvas.

## Who is this for?

This library is based on the excellent [canvas-txt](https://canvas-txt.geongeorge.com) but focuses instead on being a part of the rendering pipeline instead of drawing the text for you. This offers greater flexibility for those who need it. Additionally canvas-hypertxt focuses on layout performance, allowing for much faster overall layout and rendering performance compared to the original library. Some sacrifices are made in the name of performance (justify).

## Comparison vs canvas-txt

While canvas-hypertxt does not set out to be a drop in replacement to canvas-txt, we can drag race them.
